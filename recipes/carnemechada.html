<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pulled beef cooked with onions, bell peppers, tomatoes and spices. Delicious and portionable!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Beef</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 pounds of skirt, flank or chuck steak</li>
<li>1 onion, quartered</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon of cooking oil, preferably corn oil</li>
<li>1 onion, sliced into rings</li>
<li>2 red bell pepers, sliced into strips</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves, minced
<li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, ground
<li>1/4 teaspoon of cumin</li>
<li>2 cups reserved beef cooking broth (from "Beef" step 2)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<h3>Beef</h3>
<li>Trim the fat off the beef and then quarter the meat. Place the meat pieces in a medium soup pot and cover them with water. Add the quartered onion and simmer for two hours, removing any scum that floats to the top.</li>
<li>Once simmered, remove the pot from heat and let it cool. Reserve 2 cups of the resulting broth. Throw away the quartered onion.</li>
<li>Take two forks and pull apart the meat into strands. Set aside.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sauce</h3>
<ol>
<li>Pour the oil into a wok and heat on medium high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper and garlic. Heat until the onion slices are soft, 4-5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and cumin. Mix well.</li>
<li>Add the strands of beef and 2 cups of beef broth, then bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes or until liquid has reduced to your taste. Stir when necessary.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and serve the resulting carne mechada straight from the wok. It pairs well with rice, beans and plantains, as in pabellon criollo.</li>
